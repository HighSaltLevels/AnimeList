# AnimeList

Thank you for taking a look at my Anime List program. It is still in progress, but you are free to look at it or try to compile it on your own machine. After I complete it, I will be adding an installer which will be a .sh file. I have also compiled this on Windows and you will find the exe in the 7z file. Unfortunately, I'm still trying to get a windows installer to work and play nicely, but until then, you should be able to run the executable from the extracted folder. In addition to that, you can move it to C:\Program Files (x86)\AnimeList and create a desktop shortcut to there for easier access.
